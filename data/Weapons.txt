	description "Despite its name, this production model of a recently designed hack job between the classic detainer, newly acquired disruptors, and some raided parts was made to deliver shield disrupting packets at long range, at the cost of some of its slowing power. The ionization effect this weapon is mockingly named after seems to be a loss byproduct of the conversion process, but also increases it's disperal radius."

	description "Essentially a TPC stretched out into a firing rig, this 'defensive' artillery weapon fires a ball of plasma that quickly spreads into a devastating wave. Alone, it has little impact on shields, but the sheer heat and impact force it transmits can melt and buckle hull plating anyway, and even carry away smaller ships."
